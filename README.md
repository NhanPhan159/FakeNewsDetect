# About

This is my final project at my university, it's a project about AI. The project solves the problem of fake news on the internet by reviewing the accuracy of the news they are reading. However, it does not solve completely the problem cause fake news is something that varies in the real world but it demonstrates the useful that AI can bring to the future.
